# 🟪 The Man Behind The Slaugher

#### Who I am
I am an independent program creator who works in Python and writes great scripts. I am based in the UK, and all my programs are fully open-source, as well as intuitive and useful. I also take program requests from anyone, just email me or DM me on discord @William_Afton#2643 .

#### Why I am
I chose this online persona because I _love_ Five Night's at Freddy's. It's my top game series and I took inspiration from the antagonist. I am making an online presence so people can benefit from my programs, from my [Wordlist Generator](https://github.com/WilliamAfton-codes/Wordlist-Generator) to my script on the Collatz conjecture, often reffered to as [3x+1](https://github.com/WilliamAfton-codes/3Xplus1)
